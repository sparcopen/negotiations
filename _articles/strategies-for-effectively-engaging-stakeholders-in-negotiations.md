Developing strategies around issues such as cancellation, licensing negotiations, and involving stakeholders effectively in library collections decisions are complex for every academic library. These discussions run in parallel to advancing agendas around scholarly communications, library publishing initiatives, user privacy, and open as an underlying strategy. Colleges and universities stand to gain enormous ground through creating strong negotiation, planning, and communication programs that center the library as domain experts and advocates. 

In support of those goals, the Campus Planning and Partnerships Working Group of the SPARC Negotiation Community of Practice offers this curated selection of sharable resources that libraries can use to help initiate and guide local conversations. There are a number of variables at work in each situation, but the most critical components for success are transparency and developing clear blueprints to navigate multiple, competing priorities. 

**Toolkits and Roadmaps**

Campus planning and partnerships require strategies and tactics to align actions, expertise, and time commitments with long term strategic outcomes. These resources offer broad overviews of how to develop roadmaps and goals for your local needs, as well as provide greater understanding of the scholarly communications system.

(2021). <https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/library_presentations/98> - Discusses one approach to developing a strategic framework for sustainable collections. Includes value-mapping exercises and a communication plan template. 

**Faculty Outreach** 

Faculty-led initiatives are powerful ways to transform the energy in stakeholder discussions and communications into actionable support. Shared governance action engages the library’s champions at the student, faculty, and administrative levels. Resolutions like these create institutional precedents for collective action and set a foundation for future partnerships.

**Administration** 

Scholarly publishing does not function like any other industry. As a result, translating strategic needs to campus administration can be challenging to do concisely in a way that communicates both the complexity and urgency of these issues.
