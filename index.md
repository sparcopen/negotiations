about_text: "The SPARC Journal Negotiation Community of Practice (CoP) is a community-led effort to assist libraries in the development of a more equitable journal negotiations landscape. This site hosts resources built by the community of practice that are designed to support libraries through the entirety of the subscription negotiations lifecycle. The CoP is composed of library community volunteers, primarily from the SPARC membership, who have collaborated to create resources detailing campus communication strategies, data analysis techniques, alternative access approaches, and reinvestment profiles and opportunities after a cancellation."
